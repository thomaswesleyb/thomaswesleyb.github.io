<h2>November 24</h2>

<p>
  Today...
  I continued to work on my algorithms course, coded on codewars, and submitted some job applications. 
  I don't have a lot of time to write extensive blog posts, so I've decided to (at least for now) use this blog primarily as a way to keep myself accountable.
  I haven't done this before, so I'm excited to see how it works!
