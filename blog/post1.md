<h2>November 19, 2021</h2>
My first blog post! I will be using this blog to document my progress. More than anything its purpose is keeping me accountable, with the ultimate goal of learning more about data science and software development. I plan on posting here (almost) every day.
<br>
<br>
I will allow for some exceptions to this rule. I am studying abroad in South Korea right now, so if I were to do a day hike in Busan or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukhansan">Bukhansan</a> I probably wouldn't be able to post here then. 
<br>
Note that this is not a travel blog, just a programming blog for keeping me consistent. Through watching endless YouTube videos on productivity and becoming a software dev, I think I've identified a common theme: make habits. And have those habits make habits for you. Wait no that's money. Make money. And have that money make money.
<br>
<br>
I think I've confused myself.
<br>
<br>
Err, the point is: habits will normalize something, and when you've made a habit things will feel abnormal if you stop doing it, and the whole point is so you don't stop doing that something. Because you want to get better. Pretty sure I understand. Anyway, I'm writing this blog and hoping I'll stick to it. 
<br>
<br>
How are you supposed to end these things?
