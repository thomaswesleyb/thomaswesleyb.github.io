<h2> April 3rd </h2>

<p>
  So it's been a while, thought I would add an update to this. First, I have accepted a job offer and will be starting work this summer. 
  Second, I am done studying data structures/algorithms for now.
  Third, that I have decided to devote myself to studying computational linguistics: I am going to make a roadmap for myself and do my best to follow it.
  I would also like to participate in some comp ling communities, though there is no guarantee I will be successful in this. Most important is that
  I focus on studying CL. To start, I will read some books on it. Then perhaps I will follow a course online. I need to go over probability and statistics
  again.
